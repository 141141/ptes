[[ arp-replay packet ]]

[ 1 ] (leave our machine, and sent to victim)
 
We will start with the first 6 bytes of the dump, 
the destination mac address needs to be changed to 
reflect the victims MAC address :::

[ 2 ] The next six bytes are the source MAC address :::
source is our attacking machines MAC address :::

leave everything else the untouched & move down to the 
Sender MAC address: portion of the wireshark dump:::

[ 3 ] Since we are sending the packet, Sender MAC address: 
is the attacking machines MAC :::

[ 4 ]  Sender IP address: 
Going to contain our spoofed IP request. We are trying to
update the victims ARP cache, and make it think that the 
gateway IP address has our attacking MAC address :::
Update the H3X dump so that the sender IP address appears 
that if it came from the default gateway.

[ 5 ] The next 6 bytes is our Target MAC address:
Once again that is the MAC of the machine we are 
trying to contact (victim)

[ 6 ] The Target IP address: is that of the victim machine.

[[ arp-gateway packet ]]

[ 1 ] Destination MAC addresses

As this packet is going to the gateway, the destination
MAC address is the Gateway MAC Address :::

[ 2 ] The source MAC is the attacking MAC :::

[ 3 ] The Sender MAC address is the attacker MAC address :::

[ 4 ] Sender IP Address is the field that we want to SPOOF,
we are trying to convince the gateway to associate our MAC
address with the IP address of our victim machine :::
Sender IP address is that of the victim :::

[ 5 ] Target MAC address: is that of the Gateway :::

[ 6 ] Target IP Address is the Gateway IP :::
